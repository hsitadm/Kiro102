# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The On-Call Rotation Calendar is a modern web application designed to generate and manage interactive schedules for operations teams distributed across multiple time zones. The system will ensure equitable distribution of on-call shifts while respecting work-hour constraints, time zone advantages, and personal circumstances. The calendar will optimize coverage to maintain 24/7 operational support for clients across Latin America, with capabilities to adjust for special circumstances and publish to external platforms. The system will maintain historical data and provide statistical insights to help managers make informed decisions about shift distribution.

5. WHEN a collaborator reports sick leave THEN the system SHALL provide options for immediate schedule adjustments.

### 4. Team Composition Management

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want to add or remove team members from the on-call rotation, so that the system reflects current team composition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new collaborator joins the team THEN the system SHALL incorporate them into future schedules.
2. WHEN a collaborator leaves the team THEN the system SHALL remove them from future schedules.
3. WHEN team composition changes THEN the system SHALL rebalance workloads equitably.

### 5. Schedule Generation and Balancing

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want the system to generate balanced schedules, so that workload is distributed fairly among team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating schedules THEN the system SHALL distribute shifts equitably among all collaborators.
2. WHEN scheduling weekday morning and afternoon shifts THEN the system SHALL allow 1-3 collaborators per shift.
3. WHEN possible THEN the system SHALL prioritize more collaborators during morning shifts.
4. WHEN scheduling night shifts THEN the system SHALL assign exactly one collaborator per shift.
5. WHEN generating a new month's schedule THEN the system SHALL consider historical workload data.
6. WHEN a collaborator exceeded 160 hours in the previous month THEN the system SHALL prioritize them for reduced hours in the current month.
7. WHEN a collaborator worked fewer than 160 hours in the previous month THEN the system SHALL prioritize them for additional hours in the current month.
8. WHEN generating schedules THEN the system SHALL allow creation for a specific month or a custom date range.
9. WHEN presenting a generated schedule THEN the system SHALL display it alongside a table showing the distribution of hours per collaborator.
10. WHEN the manager reviews a proposed schedule THEN the system SHALL allow them to accept it or request a new generation.
11. WHEN requesting a new schedule generation THEN the system SHALL allow the manager to add comments to guide the adjustments.

### 6. Calendar Publication and Integration

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want to publish the generated schedule to external platforms, so that team members can access it through familiar tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a schedule is finalized THEN the system SHALL provide functionality to publish it to Google Calendar.
2. WHEN a schedule is finalized THEN the system SHALL provide functionality to publish it to Jira.
3. WHEN publishing to external platforms THEN the system SHALL include all shift details and assignments.

### 7. AI-Assisted Schedule Adjustments

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want AI-assisted recommendations for schedule adjustments, so that I can make informed decisions when changes are needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a schedule adjustment is needed THEN the system SHALL use AI to generate optimal alternatives.
2. WHEN AI generates schedule alternatives THEN the system SHALL present them to the manager for selection.
3. WHEN the manager selects an alternative THEN the system SHALL implement the chosen schedule adjustment.
4. WHEN generating alternatives THEN the system SHALL maintain all scheduling constraints and preferences.

### 8. User Interface and Experience

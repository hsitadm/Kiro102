# Design Document: On-Call Rotation Calendar

## Overview

The On-Call Rotation Calendar is a web-based application designed to generate, manage, and visualize on-call schedules for distributed operations teams. The system will optimize shift assignments based on complex business rules, time zone considerations, and individual collaborator constraints while ensuring fair distribution of workload.

The application will provide an interactive interface for managers to generate schedules, make adjustments with AI assistance, and publish to external platforms. It will also offer statistical insights and maintain historical data for continuous improvement of the scheduling process.

## Architecture

The application will follow a modern web architecture with clear separation of concerns:

2. **Business Rule Violations**: Clear explanations when schedule generation violates business rules
3. **Integration Errors**: Robust handling of external system integration failures
4. **Concurrency Issues**: Optimistic locking to prevent conflicting updates
5. **Logging**: Structured logging with appropriate severity levels
6. **Error Reporting**: Centralized error reporting with notification capabilities

### Error Response Structure

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components and services in isolation
- Mock dependencies to focus on specific functionality
- Achieve high code coverage for core business logic

### Integration Testing
- Test interactions between components
- Verify database operations and external integrations
- Use test containers for database testing

### End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user workflows

- Validate business rules implementation
- Ensure usability for all user roles

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Implement secure authentication using industry standards (OAuth 2.0, JWT)
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control for different user types
3. **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
4. **Input Validation**: Thorough validation of all user inputs
5. **API Security**: Rate limiting, CORS configuration, and request validation
6. **Audit Logging**: Track all significant system events and user actions

## Deployment Architecture
